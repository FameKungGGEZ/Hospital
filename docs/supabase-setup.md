# Supabase Setup

## 1. Local App Keys

In the Supabase Dashboard, open the project settings and copy the Project URL and publishable/anon key into the ignored `.env.local` file:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<publishable-or-anon-key>
```

These are the only Supabase values allowed in the browser app. Never put the service-role key in a `VITE_` variable or commit it.

## 2. Database Migrations

Apply migrations in order from the Supabase SQL Editor or the Supabase CLI:

1. `supabase/migrations/202609280001_initial_schema.sql`
2. `supabase/migrations/202609280002_student_roster_rollover.sql`
3. `supabase/migrations/202609280003_public_api_rate_limits.sql`
4. `supabase/migrations/202609290001_public_reports_and_roster_archive.sql`
5. `supabase/migrations/202609290002_add_return_to_class_note.sql`
6. `supabase/migrations/202609290003_service_record_permissions.sql`
7. `supabase/migrations/202609300001_incremental_student_roster_import.sql`

The second migration archives the previously active academic records and upserts the new roster in one transaction. Old academic records and service records remain available for reports and history.
The fourth migration creates the public-report setting (disabled by default), private annual archive storage, and the admin-only roster archive function.
The fifth migration adds “กลับห้องเรียน” to the service note catalog.
The sixth migration makes service history read-only for authenticated users; writes remain available through the server-side submission function.
The seventh migration allows the active roster to be imported in batches during the same academic year, while the first batch of a new year still rolls over records from the previous year.

## 3. First Admin Account

1. In Supabase Authentication, create or invite the staff Auth account using its school email and a newly chosen password.
2. Copy that Auth user's UUID from the Dashboard.
3. Insert the matching profile in the SQL Editor, replacing the placeholders:

```sql
insert into public.users (id, username, display_name, role, active)
values ('<auth-user-uuid>', '<username>', '<staff-display-name>', 'admin', true);
```

The username login function resolves the username to this Auth user and then verifies the password with Supabase Auth. The password is never stored in `public.users`.

## 4. Edge Functions

Deploy these functions after linking the CLI to the Supabase project:

```powershell
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
npx supabase functions deploy username-login
npx supabase functions deploy student-lookup
npx supabase functions deploy service-submit
npx supabase functions deploy public-recent-reports
```

Supabase provides the function runtime's `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. The service-role key must only be used in Edge Function runtime secrets.

## 5. Annual Roster Rollover

1. Sign in as an admin and open Settings.
2. Select “สำรองและ archive รายชื่อปัจจุบัน”. The app creates service-history XLSX/PDF and illness-statistics XLSX/PDF files, uploads them to the private `annual-report-archives` bucket, and only then archives the active roster.
3. Confirm the success message, then import the approved new-year roster from the Import page.
4. Archived files can be downloaded from Settings, History, or Report. Historical service records are retained and remain available to staff.

Enable public reports from Settings only when the school has approved exposing the listed health/service details. The setting is off by default, and the public Edge Function enforces it independently of the page button.

## 6. Vercel

Import the repository into Vercel and set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in the project's Environment Variables for Preview and Production. Deploy a Preview first; only promote it after roster import, staff login, student lookup, service submission, history, statistics, and export have been checked.

## 7. Data and Privacy

- Upload the approved academic-year roster only after the staging project and admin account are ready.
- The roster rollover operation does not delete prior-year academic records or service history.
- Reset any password previously shared outside the password manager before creating the production Auth account.
- Configure an allowed website origin and rate limits for public Edge Functions before public production traffic.
